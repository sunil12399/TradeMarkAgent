# TradeMarkAgent
Creating an AI Agent for searching registered trademarks and identifying classes under which a business should register its goods and services using Groq, Agno and Llama model.

Registering for trademark is a cumbersome process. It involves the following processes:

1. Determine Trademark Eligibility
  - Ensure your mark (name, logo, slogan, etc.) is unique and not already in use.
  - Avoid generic or descriptive marks that might not qualify for protection.
2. Conduct a Trademark Search
  - Perform a search on the trademark database of the relevant jurisdiction:
  - U.S.: USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office)
  - India: IP India
  - Europe: EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office)
  - Check for similar existing trademarks to avoid conflicts.
3. Choose the Right Trademark Class
  - Trademarks are categorized into different classes based on the type of goods/services.
  - Use the Nice Classification System to find the relevant class.
4. File the Trademark Application

Of the above four steps, our AI agent supports the user in the 2nd and 3rd Steps - checking the trademark databases for similar trademarks and choosing the right trademark class.
